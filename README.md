# Auth App - Firebase Authentication

## Overview

The Auth App is a user authentication application built using React and Firebase Authentication. It provides secure and easy-to-use features for user management, including Sign-Up, Login, Forgot Password, and Change Password. This app allows users to create accounts, log in, recover passwords, and securely update their passwords, providing a robust authentication solution for modern web applications.

### Features

- Sign-Up: Users can create a new account by providing their email address and password. This securely registers the user in Firebase Authentication.
  
- Login: Users can sign in with their email and password, which Firebase Authentication verifies for validity.

- Forgot Password: Users who forget their password can request a reset email to recover their account, leveraging Firebaseâ€™s built-in reset functionality.

- Change Password: Authenticated users can update their passwords directly from the app, ensuring they can manage their credentials securely.

- Doubt Form (EmailJS Integration): Integrated with EmailJS, the app includes a Doubt Form that allows users to submit queries or requests, which are sent via email to the admin or support team.

### Technologies Used

- React: Frontend UI framework used to build the user interface and manage state efficiently.
- Firebase Authentication: Cloud-based authentication service for handling user sign-ups, logins, and password management.
- EmailJS: Service integrated to handle form submissions and send queries via email.
- JavaScript/ES6+: The primary language used for building the app's logic and components.
